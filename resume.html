					<ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="http://www.2checkout.com">http://www.2checkout.com</a>
                            <p>2Checkout.com's home page and supporting content and community pages.</p>
                            <p>2Checkout.com runs on top of WordPress with a custom theme and many custom extensions written by me.  I was responsible for updating and maintaining the WordPress installation as well as developing any additional functionality needed for the community site.</p>
                        </li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://developers.2checkout.com">http://developers.2checkout.com</a>
							<p>A development community / suite of tools for developers who interact with 2Checkout.com.</p>
							<p>I wrote all of the front and backend code for this site, as well as did the design.  Serverside processing is handled with PHP and MySQL using the CodeIgniter MVC framework, and uses bbPress for the forum.  I wrote the XHTML, CSS and JavaScript which makes up the front end.  The MooTools framework is being used for some of the JavaScript interaction.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://acmeonlinebooks.com">http://acmeonlinebooks.com</a>
							<p>A demonstration site which highlights the ease of integration with 2Checkout.com</p>
							<p>I wrote all fo the front and backend code for this site, and also created the design.  Serverside processing is handled with PHP, without a framework.  I wrote the XHTML, CSS and Javscript which makes up the front end.  No JavaScript framework is in use.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://trickeries.com">http://trickeries.com</a>
                            <p>trickeries.com is my personal website which I use to release and talk about projects I am working on or involved in.  I use it as a playground of sorts, and change its appearance and functionality often.  I try to do unique and intersting things with it.</p>
                            <p>It was named as the one of the most beautiful sites of 2008 by a prominent design blog (<a href="http://www.crazyleafdesign.com/blog/most-beautiful-websites-of-2008/">http://www.crazyleafdesign.com/blog/most-beautiful-websites-of-2008/</a>), an accomplishment I am still proud of because I have never fancied myself a designer.</p>
