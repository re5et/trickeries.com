title: Simple is my new fancy.
---

My tastes have been changing a great deal over the past year and I figured it was high time I updated my site.  I used to run WordPress, but I don't really care for it anymore.  I also haven't touched PHP since I left my last position in July, and I couldn't be more pleased with that.  I was getting quite sick of it in general.

I have been getting into things that are new and exciting for me since then, chiefly: Ruby and LISP, and the many things which go with those.  This experience has been wonderful.  I used to be of the opinion that I should focus my efforts on a single language(JavaScript), and be great at that.  The whole "jack of all trades, master of none" thing.  I have since had my mind changed, trying to follow my coder heroes, that hyperpolyglotism is the way to go.  Learning a wide variety of languages makes you better at all of them.

My site is now generated with Jekyll, and is (server side wise) totally static, and is just served up.  A site that doesn't do anything doesn't do anything stupid.  I am quite pleased with how simple it is, and it generally just feels right so far.  I use the things I use for everything else to manage my blog, and don't have to deal with a ridiculous leviathan application to do something that should be simple.

I ditched my old posts, mostly because I didn't care about much of it, and got rid of previous comments. Sorry to anyone who said anything clever or useful.

Ruby is super duper awesome and I am really getting into it.  I have a few gems in the works for a larger project I am working towards.  Coming from a crusty stale world like PHP Ruby feels magical and refreshing.  I used to miss JavaScript when I was writing PHP, now I miss Ruby when I am writing JavaScript.

I have been getting into LISP mainly because I use emacs as my editor (being that it is the one true editor) and stumpwm (because I like emacs so much).  Being able to change the whole deal of either on the fly is one of those things that keeps computing fun.

In general I have begun to eschew fanceries and complexity for minimalism.  I have stopped using a mouse in exchange for the efficiency of the keyboard.  I used to have an insane compiz setup with spinning cubes and shit tons of animation and explosions, and now I have almost nothing.  I used to have a wacky indulgent website theme, and now I have this, which was designed to look and feel like my terminal / emacs theme.  There is a manner of zen-like freedom that comes with ditching the fluff in exchange for the bare necessities.

Anyhow, the only reason that I have finally gotten around to updating this site is that I have been working on some stuff lately that I really like, and I need a place to prattle on about it.  I look forward to posting more soon and continuing my crawl down the never-ending path of hacker enlightenment.
